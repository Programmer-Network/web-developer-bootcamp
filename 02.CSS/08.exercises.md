### Exercise 1: Basic Content Box with REM Units, Box-Sizing, and Root Font-Size

**Task:** Style a simple content box with a title and a paragraph, using REM units for sizing, experiment with the `box-sizing` property, and observe changes when modifying the root font size.

**Requirements:**

- Create a `div` element containing a `h1` title and a `p` paragraph.
- Use `rem` units to set margin, padding, and border for the `div`.
- Apply `box-sizing: content-box` to the `div`, and observe the calculation of the total size (content width/height plus padding and border).
- Change `box-sizing` to `border-box` and note how padding and border are included within the width/height.
- Adjust the `div`'s width, height, padding, and border sizes in `rem` units and see the changes.
- After experimenting with `box-sizing`, modify the `font-size` property of the HTML element (root element) in your CSS. Try different sizes, such as `16px`, `20px`, or `24px`.
- Observe how the size of the box, including its padding and margin, changes in response to the root font-size adjustment. This illustrates how `rem` units are relative to the HTML element's font size.
- This exercise helps students understand the direct impact of changing the root element's font-size on elements styled with `rem` units, and the difference in element sizing with various `box-sizing` values.

Including this step will give students a more comprehensive understanding of how `rem` units work in relation to the root font size and how `box-sizing` can affect element dimensions. This knowledge is crucial for mastering responsive design principles.

#### Exercise 2: Horizontal List Menu

**Task:** Create a basic horizontal navigation menu using an unordered list, styled with inline-block display.

**Requirements:**

- An unordered list `<ul>` with several list items `<li>`.
- Apply `display: inline-block` to the list items to align them horizontally.
- Style the list items with padding and margin, using `px` or `em` units.

#### Exercise 3: Simple Image Gallery with Percentage Width

**Task:** Display a row of images with captions, setting image widths relative to the parent container's width.

**Requirements:**

- Multiple `div` elements, each containing an `img` element and a `p` caption.
- Use percentage (`%`) units to set the width of each image, demonstrating responsive design.
- Align images horizontally using `display: block` and applying `float: left` to each `div`.

#### Exercise 4: Footer with Relative Positioning

**Task:** Create a simple page layout with a header, content area, and a footer using relative positioning.

**Requirements:**

- Separate `header`, `main` (for content), and `footer` elements.
- Use `position: relative` for the footer, and demonstrate how it interacts with other elements.
- Experiment with `margin-top` in percentage (%) to control the footer's position relative to the content.

#### Exercise 5: Colored Boxes with Hover Effect and Viewport Units

**Task:** Create several boxes with different background colors, changing color on hover, using viewport units for sizing.

**Requirements:**

- Multiple `div` elements, each styled with a different background color.
- Use the `:hover` pseudo-class to change the background color when the mouse hovers over a box.
- Apply viewport units (`vw` for width, `vh` for height) to adapt the box sizes to different screen sizes.

Certainly! Let's create exercises specifically focusing on `sticky` and `fixed` positioning in CSS. These exercises will help understand how these positioning properties can be applied in different scenarios.

### Exercise 6: Sticky Navigation Bar

**Task:** Create a navigation bar that becomes sticky at the top of the page when you scroll down.

**Requirements:**

- A `header` section with some introductory content.
- A `nav` bar with a few menu items, initially positioned normally in the flow of the document.
- Apply `position: sticky` to the `nav` bar and set `top: 0`, so it sticks to the top of the viewport when scrolled past its initial position.
- Add enough content below the `nav` bar to allow for scrolling.

### Exercise 7: Fixed Sidebar

**Task:** Design a page layout with a sidebar that stays fixed on the side of the screen as the user scrolls.

**Requirements:**

- A `div` element representing the main content area and a `div` for the sidebar.
- Use `position: fixed` on the sidebar and set it to align to the left or right of the viewport.
- The main content `div` should be scrollable, with enough content to demonstrate the fixed position of the sidebar.
- Style the sidebar with a different background color to distinguish it from the main content.

### Exercise 8: Sticky Footer with Offset

**Task:** Create a footer that sticks to the bottom of the viewport but lifts up when scrolling to the bottom of the page.

**Requirements:**

- A `main` content area with sufficient content to enable vertical scrolling.
- A `footer` element styled with `position: sticky` and placed at the bottom (`bottom: 0`).
- Ensure there's an offset (like `margin-top`) for the `footer`, so it appears above the end of the main content when scrolled to the bottom.
- The footer should "stick" to the bottom of the viewport on scroll but should not overlap the main content when reaching the bottom of the page.

These exercises provide hands-on experience with `sticky` and `fixed` positioning, illustrating how they function differently and can be utilized in web layouts.
