# [Position Property](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_position.php)

In CSS, the `position` property is crucial for determining how an element is placed on a webpage. There are five main types of positioning: `static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, and `sticky`.

## Static Positioning

- **Default Behavior:** This is the default position for all HTML elements. An element with `position: static;` is positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
- **Characteristics:** You cannot use `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right` properties with a static position. The element will not be affected by these properties and will always stay in its natural place in the layout.

## Relative Positioning

- **Adjustment from Normal Position:** An element with `position: relative;` is first laid out just like a static element. After this, it can be moved around relative to its original position in the layout.
- **Offset Properties:** You can use `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` to move the element from its original position. Other content will not adjust to fill the space vacated by the element.

## Absolute Positioning

- **Position Relative to Ancestor:** An element with `position: absolute;` is removed from the normal document flow. It is then positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (if any), or otherwise relative to the initial containing block.
- **Usage of Offset Properties:** `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties are used to position the element specifically within its container. The space originally occupied by the element in the document flow is no longer reserved for it.

## Fixed Positioning

- **Viewport Relative Position:** An element with `position: fixed;` is positioned relative to the browser's viewport and does not move when scrolled.
- **Stays in Place:** This is often used for navigation menus or buttons that should remain visible on the screen as the user scrolls the page.

## Sticky Positioning

- **Toggle Between Relative and Fixed:** An element with `position: sticky;` toggles between relative and fixed positioning based on the user's scroll position.
- **Specified Offset:** It's positioned as relative until a given offset from the viewport is reached during scrolling, at which point it becomes fixed.

**HTML Example:**

```html
<div class="relative-container">
  <div class="absolute-child">Absolute</div>
</div>
<div class="fixed-element">Fixed</div>
<div class="sticky-element">Sticky</div>
```

**CSS Example:**

```css
.relative-container {
  position: relative;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.absolute-child {
  position: absolute;
  top: 10px;
  left: 10px;
}

.fixed-element {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
}

.sticky-element {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

In the provided example, `.absolute-child` is positioned absolutely within `.relative-container`, meaning it will be placed 10 pixels from the top and left of its parent. The `.fixed-element` is fixed to the bottom right of the viewport, staying in place during scrolling. The `.sticky-element` behaves like a relative element until it reaches the top of the viewport during scrolling, at which point it becomes fixed.
