# CSS Box Model

The CSS box model consists of four parts: margin, border, padding, and content. By default, the width and height of an element only include the content, but with `box-sizing: border-box`, it also includes padding and border.

**HTML Example:**

```html
<div class="box-model-example">Content</div>
```

**CSS Example:**

```css
.box-model-example {
  width: 200px;
  padding: 20px;
  margin: 10px;
  border: 5px solid black;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

This sets a box with a total width of 200px, including padding and border.
