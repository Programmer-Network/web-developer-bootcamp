Welcome, future developers! This repository contains code and examples used in the [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMIfYCA9o12rEg8pczVMq-Y6tRlZGhsvG&si=RF2uQ_y0Mfow7xj9) course. This document will be updated with new lessons and concepts as I record new videos. In simple terms, this is a living document that will evolve over time.

## Resources

To learn and develop effectively, like all other developers, including myself, you must rely on documentation.

Generally, the best resources are official documentation. Here are some highly recommended ones:

- [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/): A comprehensive collection of various API documentation.
- [MDN - Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/): An invaluable resource for web development, offering detailed documentation and guides.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/): A user-friendly site with tutorials and references covering web development topics.
