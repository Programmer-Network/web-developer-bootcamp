# [CSS Box Model](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp)

The CSS box model is an essential concept in web design, defining the structure of every HTML element on a page. It consists of four parts: margin, border, padding, and content. The `box-sizing` property plays a key role in controlling how these elements are sized.

By default, an element's width and height only include the content. However, with `box-sizing: border-box`, these dimensions also encompass the padding and border, which is crucial for predictable layout behavior.

**Example: Creating Three Cards Side by Side**

To illustrate this, let's create an example with three cards displayed side by side using `inline-block`. Each card will have its own padding, border, and margin, showcasing their effect on the overall layout.

**HTML Structure:**

```html
<div class="card">Card 1</div>
<div class="card">Card 2</div>
<div class="card">Card 3</div>
```

**CSS Styling:**

```css
.card {
  width: calc(33.3% - 10px);
  height: 100px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 1px dotted tomato;
  color: tomato;
  display: inline-block;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  box-shadow: 5px 15px 5px 2px #eaeaea;
  border-radius: 4px;
}
.card:nth-child(1),
.card:nth-child(2) {
  margin-right: 5px;
}
```

In this example, each `.card` is styled with `display: inline-block`, which allows the cards to sit side by side. The `box-sizing: border-box` ensures that the padding and border are included in the total width and height of each card. The margin creates space between the cards. This example is a simple yet effective way to demonstrate how the box model's components interact and affect an element's dimensions and spacing on a webpage.
